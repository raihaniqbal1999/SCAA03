a) To encrypt content at the edge
b) To control access to restricted content
c) To enable geo-blocking
d) To configure cache behaviors
Answer: b) To control access to restricted content

Answer: b) Dynamic content is cached but bypasses Regional Edge Caches
Explanation: The article states that "Dynamic content is cached" but also mentions that "Dynamic content goes straight to the origin and does not flow through Regional Edge caches."

Question: In a high-availability setup with CloudFront origin failover, what determines when CloudFront switches to the secondary origin?
a) When the primary origin's health check fails
b) When the cache hit ratio drops below a certain threshold
c) When the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure responses
d) When the number of requests to the primary origin exceeds a limit
Answer: c) When the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure responses
Explanation: The article mentions that in origin failover, "CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure responses."
