a) To encrypt content at the edge
b) To control access to restricted content
c) To enable geo-blocking
d) To configure cache behaviors
Answer: b) To control access to restricted content

Question: In a high-availability setup with CloudFront origin failover, what determines when CloudFront switches to the secondary origin?
a) When the primary origin's health check fails
b) When the cache hit ratio drops below a certain threshold
c) When the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code failure responses
