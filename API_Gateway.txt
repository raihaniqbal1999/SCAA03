a. Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers.
b. Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers, but with provisioning or managing servers.
c. Both a and b.
d. None of the above.
Answer: a. Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers.
Explanation: The term "Serverless" in the context of API Gateway refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers.

Which of the following statements is true regarding the term "Serverless" in the context of API Gateway?

a. Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers.
b. Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers, with provisioning or managing servers.
c. Both a and b are true statements.
d. None of the above.
Answer: c. Both a and b are true statements.
Explanation: Both statements "Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers" and "Serverless refers to the ability to create and manage APIs without provisioning or managing servers, with provisioning or managing servers" are true statements in the context of "Serverless" in API Gateway.

Which of the following is a valid endpoint type in Amazon API Gateway?
a. Edge-Optimized
b. Regional
c. Private
d. All of the above

Answer: d. All of the above
Explanation: The article mentions three endpoint types in Amazon API Gateway: Edge-Optimized (default), Regional, and Private. The Edge-Optimized endpoint is suitable for serving clients globally, the Regional endpoint is designed for clients within the same AWS region, and the Private endpoint can only be accessed from within a VPC using an interface VPC endpoint.

Which endpoint type is suitable for serving clients globally in Amazon API Gateway?
a. Edge-Optimized
b. Regional
c. Private
d. None of the above

Answer: a. Edge-Optimized
Explanation: The article states that the Edge-Optimized endpoint type "is the default configuration and is suitable for serving clients globally. Requests are routed through CloudFront edge locations, which helps improve latency for users around the world."

Which of the following statements about the Regional endpoint type in Amazon API Gateway is true?
a. It is designed for clients within the same AWS region as the API Gateway.
b. It involves CloudFront by default for content delivery.
c. It can only be accessed from within a VPC using an interface VPC endpoint.
d. None of the above.

Answer: a. It is designed for clients within the same AWS region as the API Gateway.
Explanation: The article mentions that the "Regional endpoint type is designed for clients within the same AWS region as the API Gateway. It doesn't involve CloudFront by default, but you can manually configure CloudFront in front of a regional endpoint for more control over caching strategies and distribution."

What is the purpose of the Private endpoint type in Amazon API Gateway?
a. To restrict access to the API to resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
b. To serve clients globally with low latency
c. To provide more control over caching strategies and distribution
d. None of the above

Answer: a. To restrict access to the API to resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
Explanation: The article states that "Private endpoints are used when you want to restrict access to your API to resources within your Virtual Private Cloud. Requests are allowed only from within the VPC using an interface VPC endpoint (Network Load Balancer)."

Which of the following statements about securing APIs with custom domain names in Amazon API Gateway is true?
a. HTTPS security is automatically enabled when using a custom domain name.
b. HTTPS security can be enabled by integrating with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and setting up a custom domain name.
c. Custom domain names are only supported for Edge-Optimized endpoints.
d. Custom domain names are not supported in Amazon API Gateway.

Answer: b. HTTPS security can be enabled by integrating with AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and setting up a custom domain name.
Explanation: The article mentions that "securing your API with HTTPS through ACM and using custom domain names helps ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the communication between clients and your API."

Which of the following is NOT a supported integration type in Amazon API Gateway?
a) AWS Integration
b) AWS_PROXY Integration
c) HTTP Integration
d) SOAP Integration

Answer: d) SOAP Integration
Explanation: Amazon API Gateway supports AWS Integration, AWS_PROXY Integration (Lambda Proxy), HTTP Integration, HTTP_PROXY Integration, and MOCK Integration. However, it does not support SOAP Integration directly as it is designed for RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs.

Which of the following statements about API Gateway caching is TRUE?
a) Caching is enabled by default for all API methods.
b) Cache settings can be overridden for specific methods.
c) Cached responses cannot be encrypted.
d) The minimum cache capacity is 1GB.

Answer: b) Cache settings can be overridden for specific methods.
Explanation: Caching is not enabled by default in API Gateway. You have to provision an API Gateway cache and specify its size. Caches can be encrypted. The cache capacity can range from 0.5GB to 237GB, not a minimum of 1GB.

Which of the following is NOT a valid use case for Stage Variables in Amazon API Gateway?
a) Configure HTTP endpoints for different stages (dev, test, prod).
b) Pass configuration parameters to AWS Lambda through mapping templates.
c) Indicate the corresponding Lambda alias for canary deployments.
d) Store sensitive data like database credentials.

Answer: d) Store sensitive data like database credentials.
Explanation: Stage Variables should not be used to store sensitive data like database credentials as they are not designed for that purpose. They are mainly used for configuring endpoints, passing parameters to Lambda, and indicating Lambda aliases.

What is the maximum concurrent request limit set by Amazon API Gateway across all APIs within an AWS account?
a) 10,000 requests per second
b) 5,000 requests
c) 1,000 requests per second
d) No limit is enforced by API Gateway

Answer: b) 5,000 requests
Explanation: By default, API Gateway limits the maximum concurrent requests to 5,000 requests across all APIs within an AWS account. The steady-state request rate is limited to 10,000 requests per second.

Which of the following statements about Amazon API Gateway Usage Plans and API Keys is TRUE?
a) Usage Plans are used to control access to API Stages and methods, and API Keys identify API clients.
b) API Keys can only be generated by API Gateway and cannot be imported from external sources.
c) Usage Plans cannot be used to configure throttling or quota limits for individual API Keys.
d) API Keys are required even when using IAM roles and policies for access control.

Answer: a) Usage Plans are used to control access to API Stages and methods, and API Keys identify API clients.
